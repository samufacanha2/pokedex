  WORK IN PROGRESS

  Pokedex-like website, built fetching the pokeapi. As of last version, all gens are working, but the individual pokemon pages are very simple and ugly.

To do:

 - Add more pokemon info to the individual pages;
 - Add auto color coding for the pokemon types;
 - Add fetching error treatment and an image loading animation;
 - Add a searching function and a navigation menu.
